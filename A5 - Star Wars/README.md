I wrote this shit in just 30 hours :) so it's not perfect or anything but I like it<br /><br />
for playing simply type this in your terminal
```
  make
```
 and then
```
  ./starwars.out ./assets/maps/maps.txt
```
you can also add your own map but you should follow the convention
(btw you need to install sdl libraries to play this game)
